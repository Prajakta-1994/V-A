Opaque watercolour, gold and ink on woven paper
Mysore, Karnataka, 1670
IS.76-2001
Given by Francesca Galloway
The Mahabharata is one of India’s great epic poems, written in Sanskrit. It tells the story of the war between the five Pandava princes and their enemies, the Kauravas. At one point Yudhishthira, the eldest of the Pandava brothers, loses his kingdom in a game of dice. The Pandavas and their joint wife Draupadi then have to spend 13 years in exile. The Virataparva section concerns the 13th year of exile, when the Pandavas were obliged to live with secret identities in the court of Virata."
