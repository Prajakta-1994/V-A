"record/summaryDescription","This page is from a manuscript of the Razmnama, or Book of War, copied in the late 16th century at the Mughal court. It was the Persian translation commissioned by the emperor Akbar of the Sanskrit epic text, the Mahabharata. Here, the sage Vyasa accompanied by three disciples in his hermitage, observes his son, Shuka, approaching them through the air like a ball of fire.The painting was purchased for the museum from the executors of the late J. C. French with the assistance of the National Art Collections Fund in 1955."

The Razmnama, or ‘Book of War’, is the Persian version of the Mahabharata. Akbar commissioned the translation so that everyone at court could read this major text of Hinduism. In this way, he hoped to promote understanding between the followers of different religions within the empire. The translation was finished by 1587. This page comes from a slightly later, dated manuscript which had at least 200 paintings before it was broken up and sold on the London art market in 1921."
