The paintings in this series are executed in the traditional Indian mode of visualizing space in horizontal bands or registers. There is no sense of realism and no spatial perspective whatsoever. The shaded sky and persianate railing are Mughal influences. The attenuated male figures and graceful females clothed in pale lavenders, dull greys and greens, though not as heavily shaded as popular Mughal prototypes are nevertheless derived from that idiom.

The monsoon season is depicted here with lush greenery, peacocks hidden amongst the trees and a black sky with swirls of grey threatening thunderclouds and gold curls of lightning. Krishna and Radha are seated on a carpeted terrace in a house occupying the entire left section of the illustration. Radha tempts her beloved to stay by offering sweet delicacies.

Translation taken from Dwivedi, V.P., 'Barahmasa. the Song of Seasons in Literature in Art.' 1980.","This series seems to be drawn, composed and coloured by one artist and is so similar to a Bundi Baramasa painting in Pal, P. 'Dancing to the Flute', p.88, as to suggest them belonging to the same series.  The similarity in foliage depiction, architectural details such as the predominant use of white and green, patterning on walls and rooftops, Krishna's face presenting a distinctive profile with large Bundi eye and prominent nose in all paintings in this series point to the hand of one master artist. Krishna's crown on top of an orange turban is present in all of the paintings including the one in Pal, '97, which  further corroborates these belonging to the same series.

This early Bundi series has a vibrant spirit that is imparted by the interplay of brilliant colours, intense emotional cross currents between the lovers that convey the bhakti or devotion of the times, and a lyricism that makes the paintings come alive. The emphasis on diagonal lines impart movement; the lush vegetation and sensuous figures all contribute to the dynamic vibrancy of these works. The figures are modelled and shaded after Mughal painting to impart volume.","Pal 1993 / Pleasure Gardens of the Mind: Indian Paintings from the Jane Greenough Green Collection; Blurton 2006 / Bengali Myths; Ahluwalia 2008 / Rajput Painting: Romantic, Divine and Courtly Art from India",Not on display,"Exhibited:

As his consort, Fitna (also spelled Fitneh), strummed the harp, he proceeded to shoot off the antlers of the stag and shoot two arrows into the head of the doe to make two 'antlers' where none had been before.
According to John Seyller, this and 1920,0917,0.59 come from a Khamsa of Amir Khusraw Dihlavi in the Staatsbibliothek in Berlin. The ms. is dated 1610-11.; This scene depicts part of a popular story about the Sasanian ruler Bahram V (ruled AD 420–438), known for his hunting prowess as Bahram Gur (Persian for ‘onager’, a fast-running wild ass). Boasting to his servant Dilaram that he could transform a stag into a doe and vice versa, the ruler shoots the antlers off a stag and forms a pair of antlers on a doe by piercing its head with two arrows. Rooted in oral tradition, this tale was recounted and illustrated in several versions. The scene featured here is from the Hasht bihisht (Eight paradises), one of the five stories included in the Indo-Persian poet Amir Khusraw Dihlavi’s version of the Khamsa.

Opaque watercolour on paper
Although many illustrators of the 'Seven Princesses' section of Nizami's Khamesh concentrated on portraying Bahram Gur visiting the princesses in their different pavillions, other artists preferred to show him in his heroic role of hunter, 'par excellance', slaying dragons, lions or less ferocious animals such as wild asses and deer.; Bahram Gur slays a dragon
Bahram Gur was a Sasanian ruler who reigned from 420-438 AD.  His reputation as a kind monarch as well as an exceptional lover and huntsman gaiend him particular admiration among later Persian poets and writers. Here, he is portrayed as a heroic dragon slayer in an illustration of the epic poem, the Haft Paykar (The Seven Portraits) written by the great Persian poet Nizami. (b. 1141AD).  The dragon in this painting is derived from well-established Persian, Chinese and Indian conventions, including its scaly pink-spotted hide, fire spouting wings, sharp pointed fans and in this case its fiery breath.","Rogers 1983a / Islamic Art and Design, 1500-1700",Not on display,"Exhibited:
