"record/objectHistory","The paper flap bears a stamped cartouche containing the number 3942 in Hindi numerals. This cartouche also appears on pictures in the N. C. Mehta collection in Ahmedabad, but is said to be the Mandi state darbar stamp. In style, these pictures derive from the so-called 'popular Mughal style' of the early 17th century and have affinities with the work of the Ajmer (Sawar) school of ca. 1700. Others from the set are reproduced in the Sotheby catalogue for December 17th, 1969 (Lots 165 to 175). "
