"record/summaryDescription","The Mughal emperor Akbar had the primary Sanskrit texts translated into Persian, the language of the court and of the elite of the empire. This page is from a translation of the Harivamsha, which describes the origins of the cosmos and the legendary history of kings leading up to the birth and life of Lord Krishna. It is associated with the Mahabharata. The translation was done in about 1590. In this episode Krishna drags his uncle Kamsa, the tyrant king of Mathura, by his hair from his throne. He then kills him."

The Harivamsha describes the creation of the cosmos and the legendary history of kings leading up to the birth of Lord Krishna. Akbar ordered a translation of the Sanskrit text into Persian, the cultural language of the court and official language of the imperial administration, so that his Muslim subjects could read it. Here Krishna drags his uncle, the tyrant ruler of Mathura, from his throne before killing him."
