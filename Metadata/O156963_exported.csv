"record/summaryDescription","This painting has been detached from an illustrated volume of the Razmnama, or Book of War, the Persian translation of the  Mahabharata. This Sanskrit text was translated by order of the emperor Akbar so that the Persian-speaking Muslims of his court could understand the major texts of Hinduism. Another painting from the same copy of the manuscript, which was illustrated by Akbar's artists, is dated 1598. The name of the artist, 'Kamal, son of Khem' is written in the lower border. 
The scene depicts Duryodhana who has gone with his brothers to the house of Salya to ask him to be Kama's charioteer in the great war of the title of the epic."
"record/physicalDescription","Painting, in opaque watercolour and gold on paper, four lines of Persian text are at the top of the page, above a scene of two kings on a gold throne, surrounded by courtiers and servants. The inscription in the border at the bottom includes the name of the artist, Kamal, son of Khem. The scene is an illustration from the <i>Razm-nama</i> (Persian translation of the Mahabharata), depicting Duryodhana going with several brothers to the house of Salya, asking him to be Kama's charioteer in the great war. Salya and Duryodhana sit together on the same throne. "
